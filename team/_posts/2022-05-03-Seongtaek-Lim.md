I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://www.donga.ac.kr/kor/Main.do) in March 2022. Since 2022, I have been participating in research as an undergraduate  at the [DSL Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/). My primary research interests lie in OpenStreetMap (OSM) utilizing tools like Cesium, Data Anaytics and Stream Processing
